                Everyone who codes has a <b>favorite language.</b> This happens a lot because we studied in a certain programming language, or we grasped it quickly, or it made things easier for us.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
There are several reasons to having a preferred language. However, our language might become drab at times. It is no longer maintained by the firm that makes it, or people quit using it for some unexplained reason.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Other languages, such as C, which continues to be <b>the most popular programming language</b> in many circumstances, have withstood the test of time.
<br>
<br>
 <br>
The point is that programming languages appear to have a life cycle, and the end appears to have arrived for some.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are several languages whose future appears to be bleak:
            </p>
            <h2>
                <strong>1. Visual Basic .NET</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
                There used to be <b>Visual Basic 6</b>, but Microsoft appears to have wished to do rid with it and instead launched the <b>VisualBasic .NET</b> program. However, migrating everything to this new version of Visual Basic appears to be an excruciatingly tough operation.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
This is notable because, in <b>1991,</b> Microsoft enhanced the <b>BASIC</b> language by purchasing a graphic designer from <b>Alan Cooper</b> to include it into the language.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Cooper used another language</b> at first, but Gates instructed him to change it to BASIC, which the former Microsoft CEO believed was <b>the easiest language to learn.</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As a result, <b>Visual Basic was formed,</b> ultimately including objects and sophisticated programming techniques.
<br>
<br>
<br>
But then something happened: <b>Anders Hejlsberg,</b> the man in charge of Delphi (at Borland), left the business to join Microsoft, where <strong>he started the C# project.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This language is <b>similar to Java</b> in many aspects, and after some time, <b>C# became Microsoftâ€™s new language standard.</b> Simultaneously with the birth of C#, Microsoft programmers invented <b>VisualBasic .NET,</b> which has the same syntax as BASIC but the code mimics that of C#.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Both languages made their presence known, but <b>C# </b> appears to <b>have won the popularity </b> contest. For this reason, it appears that Visual Basic is condemned to extinction.
